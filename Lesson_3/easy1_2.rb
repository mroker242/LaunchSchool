# what is != and where should you use it?

# you use it when you want to express that something is not equal something for a true or false value

if 9 != 10
  puts "yes"
else
  puts "no"
end

#put ! before something, like !user_name



# put ! after something, like words.uniq!

# this mutates the caller


# put ? before something

# turns it into a string

# what is !!

#turns it into its boolean equivalent
